# üì£ MeMeSwap: Uniswap V2 for Meme Coins

![Memeswap logo](https://i.ibb.co/CPck0ZR/DALL-E-2024-01-25-16-12-59-Design-a-logo-for-Meme-Swap-a-Uniswap-style-decentralized-token-exchange.png)

Welcome to MeMeSwap! Built as a version of Uniswap V2 specifically for Meme Coins, MeMeSwap is an automatic protocol for token swaps and liquidity provision on a decentralized network. You can create liquidity pools, provide liquidity, and swap tokens seamlessly!

## üöÄ Features
- **Swap Tokens**: Safely swap any two Meme tokens without the need for a centralized party only with 0.3% fee.
- **Add Liquidity**: Provide liquidity to pools and earn on the pro-rata share of trading fees.
- **Remove Liquidity**: Remove your liquidity anytime, access to your assets when you need them.
- **Mint LP Tokens**: Minting Liquidity Provider tokens as proof of your pro-rata share in the pool.
- **Burn LP Tokens**: Burn your LP tokens to remove liquidity and receive your pro-rata share of the pool's assets.

## üõ† Technical Features
- Uses the standard `pallet-assets` to manage multi-token swaps
- Follows the standard rewarding mechanism that rewards liquidity providers with the 0.3% of the swaps
- Exposes Traits for fetching token ratio and amount needed to swap to other pallets acting as the price oracle for existing liquidity pools

## Interfaces for other pallets:
- **TokenRatio**: This is an interface that mandates any implementing class to provide a mechanism of calculating the ratio between two tokens. The implementing class defines the type of AssetId for the tokens.
  The ratio function takes two tokens (identified by their Asset IDs) and returns a Perbill representation of their ratio. If the operation fails, it should return an error.
- **OraclePrice**: This is another interface that necessitates any implementing class to provide a mechanism of getting price information. An oracle, in this context, is the ratio of assets in the liquidity pools, which provides direct insight into the relative valuation of specific assets. The implementing class defines the type of AssetId for the tokens and the Balance type to represent their associated values.
  The `get_price_for` function takes the `asset_in` (the asset which to base the valuation), amount_in (the required amount of asset_in), and asset_out (the asset which you want to query the price for). If the operation fails, it should return an appropriate error.

**MeMeSwap: A new playground for meme coin enthusiasts. Happy Swapping!**

## Design Considerations
- My pallet assumes that AssetId is an integer generic so that it can be used for ordering. We would later on add a functionality to reward early liquidity provider creators. 


## Running locally
### Setup

Please first check the latest information on getting starting with Substrate dependencies required to build this project [here](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/install/).

### Generate docs
```sh
cargo +nightly doc --open --package pallet-dex --no-deps
```

### Development Testing

To test while developing, without a full build (thus reduce time to results):

```sh
cargo t -p pallet-dex
```

### Build

Build the node without launching it, with `release` optimizations:

```sh
cargo b -r
```

### Run

Build and launch the node, with `release` optimizations:

```sh
cargo r -r -- --dev
```

### CLI Docs

Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all CLI arguments and subcommands:

```sh
./target/release/node-template -h
```
